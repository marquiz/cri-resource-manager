# RDT (Intel® Resource Director Technology)

## Overview

Intel® RDT provides capabilities for cache and memory allocation and
monitoring. In Linux system the functionality is exposed to the user space via
the [resctrl](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/x86/intel_rdt_ui.txt)
filesystem. Cache and memory allocation in RDT is handled by using resource
control groups. Resource allocation is specified on the group level and each
task (process/thread) is assigned to one group. In the context of CRI Resource
we use the term 'RDT class' instead of 'resource control group'.

Out of the RDT technologies, CRI Resource Manager currently supports L3 cache
allocation and memory bandwidth allocation. The configuration contains a set of
RDT classes which the policies can assign containers to. In the underlying
system (on OS level) one resctrl group per RDT class) is created.

## Configuration

### Command Line Flags

| Flag      | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `-no-rdt` | Disable RDT resource management

### Dynamic Configuration

CRI utilizes configuration received from
[`cri-resmgr-agent`](../README.md#cri-resource-manager-node-agent), under the
key `rdt` in the ConfigMap containing `cri-resmgr` configuration data. The
configuration specifies a set of 'partitions' each further containing a set of
'classes'. The configuration can be dynamically updated by editing the
ConfigMap.

Partitions represent a logical grouping of the underlying classes, each
partition specifying a portion of the available resources (L3/MB) which will be
shared by the classes under it. L3 allocations between partitions are exclusive,
i.e. no overlap on the cache ways between partitions is allowed. MB
allocations do not have this property, i.e. all partitions may have 100% of
bandwidth, for example.

Classes represent the actual RDT classes that the policies assign containers
to. The set of RDT classes can be freely specified, but, one must ensure that
classes required by the active policy are specified, and, that the maxmimum
number of classes (CLOSes) supported by the underlying system is not exceeded.

CRI-RM has a built-in default configuration containing three classes
corresponding to the Pod QOS classes of Kubernetes. These are utilized by the
`static` policy.

See `rdt` in the [example ConfigMap spec](../sample-configs/cri-resmgr-configmap.example.yaml)
for an example configuration.
